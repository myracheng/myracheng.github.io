## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="imgs/me.jpg">

Hi! I'm Myra! I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at Stanford, advised by <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky">Dan Jurafsky</a>. Grounded in critical theory and humanistic insights, my work aims to address LLM-related harms and social bias, as well as reveal the implicit norms that shape the development of technologies. I am supported by the Knight-Hennessy Scholarship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

Previously, I studied computer science and <a href="https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/14990/">history</a> at Caltech, where I was advised by <a href="http://www.yisongyue.com/">Yisong Yue</a>, Joel Burdick, and Maura Dykstra. I also learned a lot from internships at Microsoft Research (with <a href='https://kal.ai/'>Adam Kalai</a>) and DeepMind! 
 
My email is myra [at] cs [dot] stanford [dot] edu.
