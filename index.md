## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="imgs/me.jpg">

Hi! I'm Myra! I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at Stanford, advised by <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky">Dan Jurafsky</a>. Grounded in critical theory and humanistic insights, my work aims to mitigate algorithmic harms from language technologies and reveal the implicit norms that shape their development, from [anthropomorphism](https://aclanthology.org/2024.eacl-long.49/) to [social biases](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.84/).

I am supported by the Knight-Hennessy Scholarship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

Previously, I studied computer science and <a href="https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/14990/">history</a> at Caltech. I've also interned at Microsoft Research (with <a href='https://kal.ai/'>Adam Kalai</a>) and on DeepMind's Language Fairness team. 
 
My email is myra [at] cs [dot] stanford [dot] edu. I'm also on [ðŸ¦†](https://x.com/chengmyra1).
