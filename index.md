## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="imgs/duck.HEIC">

Hi! I'm Myra. I'm a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Stanford. I'm currently rotating with <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky"/>Dan Jurafsky</a>. I am supported by the Knight-Hennessy Scholarship, Stanford EDGE Fellowship, and NSF GRFP.

I double-majored in computer science and <a href="https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/14990/"/>history</a> at Caltech, where I worked with Professors <a href="http://www.yisongyue.com/">Yisong Yue</a>, Joel Burdick, and Maura Dykstra.
 
My email is myra1 [at] stanford [dot] edu.
