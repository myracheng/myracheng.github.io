## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="imgs/me.jpg">

Hi! I'm Myra! I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at Stanford, advised by <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky">Dan Jurafsky</a>. Grounded in critical theory and humanistic insights, my work aims to mitigate algorithmic harms from language technologies and reveal the implicit norms that shape their development. Currently, I'm particularly interested in the imapcts of anthropomorphising LLMs.

I am supported by the Knight-Hennessy Scholarship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

Previously, I studied computer science and <a href="https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/14990/">history</a> at Caltech. I've also interned at Microsoft Research (with <a href='https://kal.ai/'>Adam Kalai</a>) and on DeepMind's Language Fairness team. 
 
My email is myra [at] cs [dot] stanford [dot] edu. I'm also on [ðŸ¦†](https://x.com/chengmyra1).
