## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="imgs/profile.jpeg">

Hi! I'm YUAN Mei! I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from Peking University, where I was fortunately advised by Prof. LI Boting and <a href="https://www.ai.pku.edu.cn/info/1165/2124.htm">Prof. SU Qi</a>. Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Information System and interned at Meituan and Apple Inc..


My primary research interest lies in the area of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. Grounded in innovative and humanistic insights, my work aims to build robust and creative AI systems that cognitively, textually, visually, and acoustically narrow the human-machine gaps in various domains(images, videos, education, culture, fine arts, etc.). Specifically:

- **Multimodal Language Grounding.**

- **Controllable & Creative Content Generation.**

- **Interdisciplinary Applications.**
