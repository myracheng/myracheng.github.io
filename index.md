I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science in the Stanford NLP group. My research focuses on understanding and improving the social outcomes of NLP technologies, such as addressing anthropomorphism, social biases, and other implicit perceptions. I am advised by <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky">Dan Jurafsky</a> and supported by the Knight-Hennessy Scholarship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 

Previously, I did my undergraduate at Caltech, where I double-majored in computer science and history. I've also spent time at Microsoft Research (on the FATE team with Alexandra Olteanu and Su Lin Blodgett, and with [Adam Kalai](https://kal.ai/)) and DeepMind.

<!-- My work aims to mitigate algorithmic harms from language technologies and reveal the implicit norms that shape their development -->
