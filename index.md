## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="imgs/me.jpg">

 Hi! I'm Myra. I'm in my final year of undergrad at [Caltech](https://cms.caltech.edu/news?keyword=Myra+Cheng), where I study computer science and history. I recently interned at Microsoft Research, where I investigated the implications of algorithmic fairness techniques, and DeepMind, where I studied biases in large language models. I also started [TechReach](https://techreach.clubs.caltech.edu/) at Caltech to explore the human and social impacts of technology.
