Hi! I'm YUAN Mei! I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from Peking University, where I was fortunately advised by Prof. LI Boting and <a href="https://www.ai.pku.edu.cn/info/1165/2124.htm">Prof. SU Qi</a>.

## Research Interest

My primary research interest lies in the area of natural language processing and multimodal learning. Grounded in innovative and humanistic insights, my work aims to build generalizable and creative AI systems that narrow the human-machine gaps in various domains(images, videos, education, culture, fine arts, etc.). Specifically:

**Multimodal Language Grounding.**

**Controllable & Creative Content Generation.Â **

**Interdisciplinary Applications.  **
