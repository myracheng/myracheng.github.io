## Myra Cheng

<img class="profile-picture" src="imgs/me.jpg">

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science in the Stanford NLP group. My research focuses on improving language technologies to better serve the populations typically overlooked in their development. Grounded in humanistic insights, I develop NLP techniques to understand the social impacts of technology, from [anthropomorphism](https://aclanthology.org/2024.eacl-long.49/) to [social biases](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.84/). I am advised by <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky">Dan Jurafsky</a> and supported by the Knight-Hennessy Scholarship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 

Previously, I did my undergraduate at Caltech, where I double-majored in computer science and history. I've also spent time at Microsoft Research (on the FATE team with Alexandra Olteanu and Su Lin Blodgett, and with [Adam Kalai](https://kal.ai/)) and DeepMind.

<!-- My work aims to mitigate algorithmic harms from language technologies and reveal the implicit norms that shape their development -->
