## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="imgs/profile.jpeg">

Hi! I'm YUAN Mei! I'm a master student in Computer Science at Peking University. Grounded in critical theory and humanistic insights, my work aims to mitigate algorithmic harms, address social bias in language models and other NLP tools, and reveal the implicit norms that shape the development of such technologies. I am supported by the Knight-Hennessy Scholarship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
 
My email is yuanmei0424 [at] gmail [dot] com.
