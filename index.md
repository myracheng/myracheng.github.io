## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="imgs/me.jpg">

Hi! I'm Myra! I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at Stanford, advised by <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky">Dan Jurafsky</a>. Grounded in critical theory and humanistic insights, my work aims to mitigate algorithmic harms, address social bias in language models and other NLP tools, and reveal the implicit norms that shape the development of such technologies. I am supported by the Knight-Hennessy Scholarship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

Previously, I studied computer science and <a href="https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/14990/">history</a> at Caltech. I've also interned at Microsoft Research (with <a href='https://kal.ai/'>Adam Kalai</a>) and on DeepMind's Language Fairness team. 
 
My email is myra [at] cs [dot] stanford [dot] edu.
